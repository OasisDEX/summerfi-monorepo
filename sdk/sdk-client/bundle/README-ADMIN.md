  logging: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
})
```

## Self Managed Vaults - Admin

### Rebalance Assets Between Arks

Rebalances assets between arks (yield sources) in a fleet. This operation moves funds from one ark
to another to optimize yield or manage risk. The keeper must ensure proper configuration limits are
set before executing a rebalance.

**Required Role:** The executing address must have the `KEEPER_ROLE` contract-specific role for the
target fleet (FleetCommander contract), or the `SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE` general role which allows keeper
operations on any fleet. See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details.

This flow includes:

1. Fetching ark configurations to check limits
2. Setting required limits (maxRebalanceOutflow, maxRebalanceInflow, depositCap) if needed
3. Executing the rebalance operation

**Parameters:**

- **vaultId**: The ID of the vault (fleet) to rebalance
- **rebalanceData**: Array of rebalance operations, each containing:
  - **fromArk**: The ark address to withdraw funds from
  - **toArk**: The ark address to deposit funds to
  - **amount**: The amount of tokens to move (as TokenAmount), to transfer the entire available
    balance use `MAX_UINT256_STRING` (see example below)

**Example:**

```typescript
import { Address, ArmadaVaultId, getChainInfoByChainId, TokenAmount, MAX_UINT256_STRING } from '@summer_fi/sdk-client'
import { sdk } from './sdk'

const chainId = ChainIds.Base
const chainInfo = getChainInfoByChainId(chainId)

const fleetAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({
  value: '0xFLEETADDRESS...',
})

const vaultId = ArmadaVaultId.createFrom({
  chainInfo,
  fleetAddress,
})

// Define ark addresses
const bufferArk = Address.createFromEthereum({
  value: '0x04acEf9ca748ABD2c2053beD4a7b6dbF8BdCCc31',
})

const aaveArk = Address.createFromEthereum({
  value: '0xC01348b33Dd2431980688DBd0D1956BA1e642172',
})

// Get the token
const usdc = await sdk.tokens.getTokenBySymbol({
  chainId,
  symbol: 'USDC',
})

// Create the amount to rebalance
const amount = TokenAmount.createFrom({
  amount: '1000',
  token: usdc,
})

// Special case: transfer the entire available balance (avoid leaving dust)
// If you want to transfer the full available balance and avoid leaving a small "dust"
// amount (which can occur due to rounding or because assets increase in value between
// operations), pass the maximum uint256 value as the amount.
// Example using the decimal string representation of MaxUint256:
const amountAll = TokenAmount.createFromBaseUnit({
  amount: MAX_UINT256_STRING,
  token: usdc,
})

// 1. Check the source ark configuration
const fromArkConfig = await sdk.armada.admin.arkConfig({
  chainId,
  arkAddressValue: bufferArk.toSolidityValue(),
})

// 2. If maxRebalanceOutflow on the fromArk is too low, update it
if (BigInt(fromArkConfig.maxRebalanceOutflow) < amount.toSolidityValue()) {
  const setMaxRebalanceOutflowTxInfo = await sdk.armada.admin.setArkMaxRebalanceOutflow({
    vaultId,
    ark: bufferArk,
    maxRebalanceOutflow: amount,
  })
  // Send transaction (implementation depends on your setup)

// 3. Check the destination ark configuration
const toArkConfig = await sdk.armada.admin.arkConfig({
  chainId,
  arkAddressValue: aaveArk.toSolidityValue(),
})

// 4. If depositCap on the toArk is too low, update it
if (BigInt(toArkConfig.depositCap) < amount.toSolidityValue()) {
  const setDepositCapTxInfo = await sdk.armada.admin.setArkDepositCap({
    vaultId,
    ark: aaveArk,
    cap: amount,
  })
  // Send transaction

// 5. If maxRebalanceInflow is too low, update it
if (BigInt(toArkConfig.maxRebalanceInflow) < amount.toSolidityValue()) {
  const setMaxRebalanceInflowTxInfo = await sdk.armada.admin.setArkMaxRebalanceInflow({
    vaultId,
    ark: aaveArk,
    maxRebalanceInflow: amount,
  })
  // Send transaction

// 6. Execute the rebalance
const rebalanceTxInfo = await sdk.armada.admin.rebalance({
  vaultId,
  rebalanceData: [
    {
      fromArk: bufferArk,
      toArk: aaveArk,
      amount,
    },
  ],
})
// Send transaction
```

**Response (TransactionInfo):**

Refer to the TransactionInfo structure in the main SDK documentation.

**Notes:**

- The executing address must have either the `KEEPER_ROLE` for the specific fleet or the
  `SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE` global role
- To grant the KEEPER role, use the Access Control methods (see Access Control section):

```typescript
import { ContractSpecificRoleName } from '@summer_fi/sdk-client'

const txInfo = await sdk.armada.accessControl.grantContractSpecificRole({
  chainId: ChainIds.Base,
  role: ContractSpecificRoleName.KEEPER_ROLE,
  contractAddress: fleetAddress, // The fleet (FleetCommander) address
  targetAddress: keeperAddress, // The address to grant the role to
})
```

## Self Managed Vaults - Access Control

### Roles Overview

The Armada Protocol uses a role-based access control system with two categories of roles:

#### General Roles (Global)

General roles apply across all contracts in the protocol:

- **SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE**: Allows keeper operations on any fleet without needing fleet-specific
  KEEPER_ROLE grants. Use this for trusted keeper addresses that manage multiple fleets.
- **GOVERNOR_ROLE**: Allows governance operations including granting/revoking roles, managing
  protocol parameters, and administrative functions. This is the highest privilege role.
- **DECAY_CONTROLLER_ROLE**: Allows control over decay-related parameters in the protocol's reward
  mechanisms.
- **ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE**: Allows operations related to Admiral's Quarters functionality.

#### Contract-Specific Roles

Contract-specific roles are scoped to individual contracts (e.g., a specific Fleet):

- **WHITELISTED_ROLE**: Allows deposits and withdrawals on a whitelisted fleet. Use this to control
  which addresses can interact with private/permissioned vaults.
- **KEEPER_ROLE**: Allows keeper operations for a specific fleet, including: executing rebalances
  between arks, requesting and claiming withdrawals for arks that require withdrawal requests (e.g.,
  Fluid, Origin, Syrup arks), whitelisting Merkl operators for reward claiming, and sweeping idle
  assets from arks with withdrawal requests back to the buffer.
- **CURATOR_ROLE**: Allows curator operations for a specific fleet, including: adding/removing arks
  from the fleet, configuring ark and fleet parameters (deposit caps, max deposit percentage of TVL,
  rebalance inflow/outflow limits, minimum buffer balance, max rebalance operations), managing
  staking rewards, configuring auction parameters for harvested rewards in the Raft, and managing
  sweepable tokens and whitelisted routers for arks with withdrawal requests.
- **COMMANDER_ROLE**: Allows direct ark operations including boarding (deposit), disembarking
  (withdraw), and moving funds between arks. This role is typically granted to FleetCommander
  contracts, not EOAs, as it allows programmatic control over ark operations.

### Check if Address Has Contract-Specific Role

Check if a given address has a specific contract-specific role for a vault (fleet contract).

This is useful for frontends or operational scripts that need to verify permissions before allowing
certain actions.

**Parameters:**

- **chainId**: The chain where the contract (fleet) is deployed
- **role**: The contract-specific role to check. Available roles: `WHITELISTED_ROLE`, `KEEPER_ROLE`,
  `CURATOR_ROLE` or `COMMANDER_ROLE`. See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details.
- **contractAddress**: The target contract (e.g. Fleet / LazyVault) address you are checking against
- **targetAddress**: The address (EOA or contract) whose role membership you want to verify

**Example:**

```typescript
import { ChainIds, Address } from '@summer_fi/sdk-client'
import { ContractSpecificRoleName } from '@summerfi/armada-protocol-common'
import { sdk } from './sdk'

// Fleet (vault) deployment address
const fleetAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xFLEETADDRESS...' })

// User / target address to check
const userAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xUSERADDRESS...' })

// Check for whitelisted role
const hasWhitelistRole = await sdk.armada.accessControl.hasContractSpecificRole({
  chainId: ChainIds.Base,
  role: ContractSpecificRoleName.WHITELISTED_ROLE,
  contractAddress: fleetAddress,
  targetAddress: userAddress,
})

console.log(
  `Address ${userAddress.value} ${hasWhitelistRole ? 'IS' : 'is NOT'} whitelisted for fleet ${fleetAddress.value}`,
)
```

**Response:**

Boolean value indicating whether the target address has the specified role.

**Notes:**

- Contract-specific roles are managed by governor (requires `GOVERNOR_ROLE`)
- Use `grantContractSpecificRole` / `revokeContractSpecificRole` methods to manage roles (see
  sections below)
- The same method works for all contract-specific roles by changing the `role` parameter
- See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details on each role's permissions

### Grant Contract-Specific Role to Address

Grant a contract-specific role to an address for a vault (fleet contract). This allows the address
to perform role-specific operations on that contract.

See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for detailed descriptions of each role and their use cases.

**Required Role:** The executing address must have the general `GOVERNOR_ROLE` to grant roles to
other addresses.

**Parameters:**

- **chainId**: The chain where the contract (fleet) is deployed
- **role**: The contract-specific role to grant. Available roles: `WHITELISTED_ROLE`, `KEEPER_ROLE`,
  `CURATOR_ROLE` or `COMMANDER_ROLE`. See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details.
- **contractAddress**: The target contract (e.g. Fleet / LazyVault) address
- **targetAddress**: The address (EOA or contract) to grant the role to

**Example:**

```typescript
import { ChainIds, Address } from '@summer_fi/sdk-client'
import { ContractSpecificRoleName } from '@summerfi/armada-protocol-common'
import { sdk } from './sdk'

// Fleet (vault) deployment address
const fleetAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xFLEETADDRESS...' })

// Address to grant the role to
const userAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xUSERADDRESS...' })

// Grant whitelisted role
const grantTxInfo = await sdk.armada.accessControl.grantContractSpecificRole({
  chainId: ChainIds.Base,
  role: ContractSpecificRoleName.WHITELISTED_ROLE,
  contractAddress: fleetAddress,
  targetAddress: userAddress,
})

// Send transaction (implementation depends on your setup)
// const txHash = await sendTransaction(grantTxInfo)
```

**Response (TransactionInfo):**

Refer to the TransactionInfo structure in the main SDK documentation.

**Notes:**

- Only addresses with the general `GOVERNOR_ROLE` can grant roles
- After granting, verify the role using `hasContractSpecificRole` method
- Contract-specific roles are scoped to individual contracts, not global
- See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details on each role's permissions

### Revoke Contract-Specific Role from Address

Revoke a contract-specific role from an address for a vault (fleet contract). This removes the
address's ability to perform role-specific operations on that contract.

**Required Role:** The executing address must have the general `GOVERNOR_ROLE` to revoke roles from
other addresses.

**Parameters:**

- **chainId**: The chain where the contract (fleet) is deployed
- **role**: The contract-specific role to revoke. Available roles: `WHITELISTED_ROLE`,
  `KEEPER_ROLE`, `CURATOR_ROLE` or `COMMANDER_ROLE`. See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for
  details.
- **contractAddress**: The target contract (e.g. Fleet / LazyVault) address
- **targetAddress**: The address (EOA or contract) to revoke the role from

**Example:**

```typescript
import { ChainIds, Address } from '@summer_fi/sdk-client'
import { ContractSpecificRoleName } from '@summerfi/armada-protocol-common'
import { sdk } from './sdk'

// Fleet (vault) deployment address
const fleetAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xFLEETADDRESS...' })

// Address to revoke the role from
const userAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xUSERADDRESS...' })

// Revoke whitelisted role
const revokeTxInfo = await sdk.armada.accessControl.revokeContractSpecificRole({
  chainId: ChainIds.Base,
  role: ContractSpecificRoleName.WHITELISTED_ROLE,
  contractAddress: fleetAddress,
  targetAddress: userAddress,
})

// Send transaction (implementation depends on your setup)
// const txHash = await sendTransaction(revokeTxInfo)
```

**Response (TransactionInfo):**

Refer to the TransactionInfo structure in the main SDK documentation.

**Notes:**

- Only addresses with the general `GOVERNOR_ROLE` can revoke roles
- After revoking, verify the role removal using `hasContractSpecificRole` method
- Revoking a role immediately removes associated permissions
- See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details on each role's permissions

### Grant General Role to Address

Grant a general role to a specific address. General roles are global and apply across all contracts
in the protocol.

See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for detailed descriptions of each role and their use cases.

**Required Role:** The executing address must have the general `GOVERNOR_ROLE` to grant general
roles to other addresses.

**Parameters:**

- **chainId**: The chain where the protocol is deployed
- **role**: The general role to grant. Available general roles: `SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE`,
  `GOVERNOR_ROLE`, `DECAY_CONTROLLER_ROLE` or `ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE`. See
  [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details.
- **targetAddress**: The address (EOA or contract) to grant the role to

**Example:**

import { sdk } from './sdk'

// Address to grant the Super Keeper role to
const keeperAddress = Address.createFromEthereum({ value: '0xKEEPERADDRESS...' })

const grantTxInfo = await sdk.armada.accessControl.grantGlobalRole({
  chainId: ChainIds.Base,
  role: GlobalRoles.SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE,
  targetAddress: keeperAddress,
})

// Send transaction (implementation depends on your setup)
// const txHash = await sendTransaction(grantTxInfo)
```

**Response (TransactionInfo):**

Refer to the TransactionInfo structure in the main SDK documentation.

**Notes:**

- Only addresses with the general `GOVERNOR_ROLE` can grant general roles
- General roles apply globally across all contracts in the protocol
- After granting, verify the role using `hasGeneralRole` method
- See [Roles Overview](#roles-overview) for details on each role's permissions

### Revoke General Role from Address

Revoke a general role from a specific address. This removes the address's ability to perform
