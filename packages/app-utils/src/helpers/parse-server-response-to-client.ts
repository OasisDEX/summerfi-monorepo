/**
 * Parses a server response object to a client-friendly format. It is needed when passing server side fetched data to client components as props.
 *
 * This function attempts to convert a server response object into a JSON string and then parses it back into an object.
 * If the parsing is successful, the result is returned as the specified type `T`.
 * In case of an error during parsing, the original response is returned, and an error is logged to the console.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The expected type of the parsed response object.
 * @param response - The server response object to parse.
 * @returns The parsed response as type `T`, or the original response if parsing fails.
