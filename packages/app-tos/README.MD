# @summerfi/app-tos

Common Terms of Service (TOS) handling for the @summerfi apps.

This package provides `useTermsOfService` hook and types which can be used to easily integrate TOS
flow in new apps.

This package do not contain any UI which should be handled / customized on the client app side.

This package assumes that the API already exists, which in the end may vary per specific app.
