]

const protocolRisks = [
  'Risks Relating to the Launch of the Protocol. The Tokens are designed to be used on the Protocol. There can be no assurance that the Tokens or the Protocol will function as intended or as described on any website or in other communications or will be maintained and further developed according to current plans. There can be no assurance that you will be able to utilize the Tokens or the Protocol in any particular way.',
  'Risks Relating to Smart Contracts and Programs. The Protocol is generally comprised of a number of smart contracts. Smart contracts and programs are computer codes that can be created and run by the users of the network on which such smart contract or program is based. A smart contract or program can take information as an input, process that information through the pre-determined rules and conditions defined in the computer code, and execute certain actions, such as Token transactions, pursuant to such programming. The use of smart contracts and programs creates substantial risk exposures. Smart contracts are self-executing once deployed, generally without reliance on a central party, and use experimental cryptography. Smart-contract risks include the following, which may affect adoption, continued use, or functioning of the Protocol and thereby your ability to use the Tokens.',
  'Flawed or Imprecise Code: Smart contract code may be imprecise or flawed. In such cases, smart contracts on the Protocol could have specifications or conditions that are implemented or executed in ways that are not expected. You may be at risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your staked digital assets through an adverse event relating to such code. Smart contracts could contain vulnerabilities or bugs that could be exploited, potentially resulting in a complete or substantial loss of your staked digital assets. Malicious actors could exploit such vulnerabilities or bugs to cause the execution of erroneous or unexpected slashing conditions or theft of your staked digital assets.',
  'Lack of Remediation: If imprecise or flawed code is discovered in a deployed smart contract, it may not be susceptible to identification ex ante and remediation may be difficult or ineffective. In some cases, the only practical remediation may include deploying a new smart contract or incorporating updating mechanisms that may be disruptive, risky, complex, costly, time-consuming, and/or unable to reverse adverse scenarios, including complete or substantial loss of your staked digital assets.',
  'Flaws in Programming Languages: The use of programming languages in smart contracts poses risks, including vulnerabilities arising from language complexity, potential bugs and flaws in language designs or compilers, limitations in functionality or performance impacting implementation, and a lack of maturity and sustained support for certain languages impacting the reliability and security of the developed contracts. Even widely used programming languages may have compiler bugs or other flaws that, if discovered and exploited, may result in substantial or total losses of your staked digital assets.',
  'Irrevocable Token Transactions: The use of a distributed ledger and blockchain technology, like Ethereum, creates a public record of Token balances that is exceedingly difficult to change once it reflects a particular state. This means that if a Token transaction were executed in error or as a result of fraud or theft, such a transaction would not be practically reversible. Consequently, the Company will be unable to replace missing or misappropriated Tokens or seek or provide reimbursement for any such erroneous transfer, fraud, or theft. The inability to reverse transactions or seek other forms of redress for such action, error, fraud, or theft could result in the permanent loss of some or all of your Tokens. This lack of redress could cause reputational harm to, and diminish participation on, the Protocol and/or adversely affect the financial viability or performance of the Company and its Affiliates.',
  'Lack of Control over Protocol: The Protocol is envisioned to be an open-source project with Protocol governance collectively controlled by the Token Holders. However, the Company or certain Affiliates control of certain multi-signature wallets relating to the Protocol temporarily right after launch, and their control of those wallets can enable certain transactions. Under current plans, and over time, the Company and the relevant Affiliates will not have control over these wallets and the Protocol, and it will not be able to control the actions of Token Holders. This means that the Company and Affiliates have engaged in substantial research and development with respect to the Protocol and its governance and security features, any future changes to the Protocol may need to be voluntarily adopted by Token Holders, including, as applicable, Token Holders participating in governance and/or as signatories for multi-signature wallets operated by the community.',
  'Reliance on Third-Parties: The Protocol itself relies on third-party software that is not controlled by the Company or its Affiliates. Any defects, updates, upgrades, modifications, flaws, vulnerabilities, defects, attacks, exploits, or shortcomings in third party code may impact the operation of the Protocol. Likewise, the Protocol itself relies upon Third Party Service Providers. Those Third-Party Service Providers could fail to perform, could perform negligently, or could willfully underperform or provide defective performance, and could take actions that would undermine or impair the Protocol.',
  'Governance Issues: Because the Company and its Affiliates will lack control over community governance and the Protocol, under current plans, and over time, the Company and its Affiliates will not be able to prevent Token Holders or others from mismanaging code, ensure that there is an adequate or timely response to emergencies or other identified risks, or adopt necessary code or governance changes. Token Holders or others may make decisions or take actions (or fail to make decisions or take actions) in ways that adversely affect you, your Tokens, Token Holders, and/or the Protocol. In addition, the Protocol may not run or function as intended, when deployed to mainnet or after changes, and in such cases, you and the Company and Affiliates may have limited recourse. Any of these could result in substantial or total losses of your digital assets and/or uses of your digital assets or your Tokens.',
  'Risks Associated with Technology: Various technology solutions are and will be incorporated into the Protocol. Some or all of these technology solutions are relatively new and/or untested. There is significant risk to building and implementing new technologies that may have never been used or that are being used in different ways. There is no guarantee that such technologies will operate as intended or as described in any marketing or other materials distributed by the Company or others or will continue to function according to current plans.',
  'Risks Associated with Slashing: The Protocol will rely upon third-party software that may include slashing. There is no guarantee that you or other Users of the Protocol will view slashing rules or conditions as precise, objective, fair, or fairly applied. There is no guarantee that any governance to mediate slashing events will be fair or impartial, or exist. The application of certain slashing rules and conditions may be challenging and/or ambiguous and lead to disagreements among Users of the Protocol. You or other Users of the Protocol could have digital assets erroneously slashed, causing substantial or total losses of your staked digital assets. Your digital assets, including your Tokens, may be partially or completely slashed despite your best efforts to validate transactions and respond to conditions as expected. Slashing, slashing attacks, and/or any perceptions of unfair slashing could result in Users of the Protocol determining not to stake their digital assets on the Protocol. A sudden change in the size and constituency of the pool of digital assets controlled by the Protocol. Any of these possibilities could diminish the use and viability of the Protocol. Any of these also could adversely impact you and adversely affect adoption of the Protocol and ultimately, your ability to use the Tokens.',
  'The Volatility and Instability of Digital Assets: At launch, the Protocol will only support a small number of digital assets, like ETH, and certain stablecoins. The Company and its Affiliates are not involved in the issuance of ETH or any stablecoins and does not vet, approve, or recommend particular tokens for use on the Protocol. When you choose to stake ETH on Ethereum or to otherwise deploy other digital assets in the Protocol, you accept certain slashing and other risks that are completely exogenous to the Protocol and beyond the Company and its Affiliates’ control. Token Holders may seek to support new types of digital assets on the Protocol. It is also possible that validated services on the Protocol could be supported by any digital asset acceptable to users of the Protocol. These assets may have widely varying characteristics and quality, and these could change and deteriorate over time. The Company and its Affiliates will not be able to control these possibilities or events, and these events may be difficult to predict and mitigate. Any of these could adversely affect economic considerations, adoption of the Protocol, and/or ultimately, your ability to use the Tokens.',
  'Insufficient Interest in the Protocol and the Token: The Protocol relies on active engagement by users to function. The Company and Affiliates make no assurance that the Protocol will generate enough interest and user engagement to be viable or continue to be viable. It is not possible at this time to evaluate whether sufficient users will participate in the Protocol and whether those users will sustainably and sufficiently engage with and use the Protocol for the Protocol to function as intended. Token Holders could mismanage, misuse, or misappropriate aspects of the Protocol or the Tokens in a manner that is detrimental to you, the Protocol, and the broader community of users. This may negatively affect your ability to use the Tokens.',
  'Multiple Other Significant Risks: It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including but not limited to, lack of interest from users or partners, inability to attract sustained third-party or community contributors to the Protocol, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of digital and fiat assets and currencies, decrease in the utility of the Tokens, failure to generate commercial relationships, legal and regulatory classification or actions, property ownership and other challenges, and macroeconomic and crypto-market-specific factors, the Protocol may no longer be viable to operate and it may be deprecated or cease to have any functionality, users, or viability.',

    'Risks of Adverse Contagion from Ethereum Events. The Protocol is comprised of a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, and the Protocol has been designed in the spirit of remaining closely aligned with the Ethereum community’s mission and roadmap. This presents the following risks, among others:',
    'Discovery of EVM Flaws. An EVM bug discovered and exploited by malicious actors could present risks to the integrity and security of the Protocol because its smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum. EVM compromises could impair expected execution of the Protocol, resulting in security vulnerabilities, data corruption that changes or obscures true data states, disruptions to operations such as withdrawals, and ultimately, substantial or total losses of digital assets, fees, or support or adoption of Ethereum-based projects, including the Protocol. This could diminish the use of Tokens and result in substantial or total losses of digital assets and confidence across the crypto markets more generally.',
    'Ethereum Hard Fork. In the event of a hard fork on Ethereum, changes could be made to the Ethereum Protocol that could make the Protocol’s smart contracts incompatible, dysfunctional, uneconomic, or more costly, which could impair the execution and interaction of smart contracts essential to the operation of Protocol. Such changes also could adversely affect the ability or incentives of users to use the Protocol. A hard fork on Ethereum could necessitate significant changes to the Protocol that, in turn, change the economics or technical processes involved in using the Protocol. Certain types of changes in consensus rules or technical implementations could present significant or even existential risks to the Protocol, such as those that could make it difficult, costly, or slashable to use the Protocol. Significant resources and time could be required for the Protocol to remain compatible with one or more forks of Ethereum or consensus rule changes. Such resources or time may be unavailable or uneconomic to provide and cannot be guaranteed to ensure continued operation of the Protocol.',
    'Insufficient Quantum Resistance. Quantum computers, if sufficiently powerful and available for use, potentially could be used to break the cryptographic algorithms used by Ethereum, the Protocol, and other platforms. This could make it possible to derive private keys from public keys, opening the door to a variety of storage and other attacks that could harm Ethereum itself, holders of ETH, and Token Holders building or transacting on the Protocol. This, in turn, could adversely affect adoption of the Protocol and ultimately, your ability to use your Tokens.',

    'Risks Relating to the Token in Particular. YOUR TOKENS MAY HAVE NO VALUE. Significant market and economic factors may adversely affect your ability to use the Tokens:',
    'No Market for the Token. There is no public market for the Token, and the Company and its Affiliates do not control the development of such a market. A public market may not develop or be sustainable, and you may not be able to sell your Tokens. Furthermore, the Company and its Affiliates cannot control how Token holders or third-party exchanges or platforms may support the Token, if at all. Even if a public market for the Token develops, such a market may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making it more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.',
    'Extreme Illiquidity. There will be significant restrictions on the transferability of your Tokens. The transfer restrictions on your Tokens will remain in place for a significant period of time. Even if a public market does eventually exist, you may not be able to freely sell or transfer your Tokens. If you can freely sell your tokens in a public market after some period of time, the depth and volume in that market may be insufficient for you to sell without substantial price concessions.',
    'Adverse Activities in Secondary Markets. Secondary market activities that are beyond the control of the Company and its Affiliates could develop that are adverse to your ability to use the Tokens. Even with significant transfer restrictions intended to support long-term alignment with the Protocol community, significant concentrations in token positions are present and may continue to be present among a relatively small group of Tokens holders, or worsen, exposing you to significant risks of volatility, herd trading, “dumping,” or other correlated secondary market activities. These risks will be considerable following expiration of the lock-up period applicable to certain Token holders. In addition, Token Holders may determine to approve grants, allocations, and/or inflationary mints of the Tokens, all of which may be fully or partially outside of the Company’s control and could incentivize harmful short-term trading activities or otherwise adversely affect you.',
    'Experimental Features and Uses. The Tokens may have experimental features and uses. Future features and uses may prove not to be valuable, usable, or viable, and contributors may fail to adequately research and develop any such upgrades. Under current plans, and over time, the Company and its Affiliates may not have the ability to effectuate upgrades to implement new features and use cases. Such upgrades may not be approved in Protocol governance or may be adopted with security flaws or with unexpected or harmful changes that are adverse to your ability to use your Tokens.',
  ],

  'Risks Relating to Governance.  The Company and certain Affiliates have control of certain multi-signature wallets that can enable certain and transactions. However, under current plans, and over time, the Protocol will be controlled by Token Holders. Thus, the Company and its Affiliates may not have control over administrative actions nor will they be able to control the decisions and actions of Token Holders. Because the Company and Affiliates will lack control over community governance, under current plans, and over time, they will have limited means to prevent Token Holders from mismanaging smart-contract code, ensure that there is an adequate or timely response to emergencies or other identified risks, or adopt necessary code or governance changes. Token Holders may make decisions or take actions (or fail to make decisions or take actions) in ways that adversely affect you, others, and/or the smart contract, including by limiting transfers of the Tokens or removing transfer restrictions, authorizing inflationary minting of the Tokens, or misappropriating a portion of the Token supply.',

  'Risks of New and Evolving Laws and Regulations. There is significant risk surrounding the ongoing development of regulatory frameworks governing blockchain technology all over the world and as the blockchain, crypto, and web3 industries continue to grow, the Company expects regulatory scrutiny to increase across jurisdictions. The Company or its Affiliates, the Protocol or Tokens may be found to be subject to certain laws or regulatory regimes that could adversely impact you, the Protocol, or the Tokens. Additionally, laws or interpretations may change and the Company or its Affiliates or the Protocol or the Tokens may be subject to new or changed laws or regulations in the future. Any restrictive or prohibitive legislation or regulation on blockchains or digital assets could impair the adoption of the Protocol and/or the use of the Tokens and adversely affect market sentiment surrounding the Protocol and/or the Tokens. To the extent licenses, permits, or other authorizations are required in one or more jurisdictions in which the Protocol or any Application is deemed to operate, there is no guarantee that the Company or another party will be able to secure such licenses, permits, or authorizations in order for the Protocol or any Application to continue to operate. Significant changes may need to be made to the Protocol to comply with any licensing and/or registration requirements (or any other legal or regulatory requirements) in order to avoid violating applicable laws or regulations or because of the cost of such compliance. Uncertainty in how the legal and regulatory environment will develop could negatively impact the development, growth, and utilization of the Protocol and therefore the uses of the Tokens.',
  'Risks of Tokens or Token Transactions Being Deemed Securities. The SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain tokens and/or certain transactions involving tokens fall within the definition of a “security” under the U.S. federal securities laws. The legal test for determining whether any given token or transaction is a security is a highly complex, fact-driven analysis that evolves with U.S. case law and developments over time, and the outcome(s) or conclusion(s) of any such legal analysis may be uncertain or evolve in ways that are difficult to predict. The SEC generally does not provide advance guidance on or confirmation of whether any particular token or transaction is or may be a security. Furthermore, the SEC’s views in this area have evolved over time and it is difficult to predict the direction or timing of any continuing evolution. It is also possible that legislative or judicial developments or a change in the governing administration or the appointment of new SEC commissioners could substantially impact the views of the SEC and its staff. Certain tokens or transactions may be deemed to be other types of regulated financial instruments or transactions in the U.S. or securities or other regulated financial instruments or transactions in other jurisdictions. As a result, certain tokens or transactions may be deemed to be “securities” or other regulated financial instruments or transactions under the laws of some jurisdictions but not others. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt additional laws, regulations, or directives that affect the characterization of certain tokens or transactions as “securities” or other regulated financial instruments. The classification of a token or transaction as a security or regulated financial instrument under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that could be imparted on the Company, Protocol, Token Holders, or holders of Tokens, including obligations that could make the Protocol not viable to continue to operate or negatively impact the development, growth, and utilization of the Protocol and liquidity and market sentiment around the Tokens.',
  'Risk of Third-Party Illegal Activity. The Protocol and the Token may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity, including fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, sanctions evasion, and scams. If any third party uses the Protocol or the Tokens to further such illegal activities, that and the legal and regulatory consequences of those activities could negatively impact the development, growth, and utilization of the Protocol. While we do not control the activities of the Protocol’s Users, the use of the Protocol for illegal or improper purposes could subject us, the Protocol, or Token holders to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, prosecutions, enforcement actions, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us, the Protocol, and/or the Token holders.',
  'Jurisdictional Risks. Certain activities that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and certain activities that are at one time legal may in the future be deemed illegal in the same jurisdiction. In the event that a Token Holder is found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently violating the laws in any jurisdiction, the Company, Protocol, and/or you and other Token holders may be subject to governmental inquiries, enforcement actions, prosecution, or held secondarily liable for aiding or facilitating such activities in researching and developing, or deploying, software that enabled such activities, being a platform on which such activities occurred, contributing to governance that authorized such activities, or being a member of a decentralized autonomous company or other group that otherwise has liability with respect to such activities.',
  'Risk of Sanctions Violations. The Company, the Protocol, or Token holders could be deemed to be violating or facilitating the violation of applicable economic and trade sanctions and export control laws and regulations, such as those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s OFAC, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the UN Security Council, and other relevant authorities. Such laws and regulations prohibit or restrict certain operations, investments, services, and sales activities, including dealings with certain countries or territories (e.g., sanctioned countries), and governments, and persons (including sanctioned entities). Although the Company does not enter into contracts or agreements with sanctioned entities or persons located in sanctioned countries, it may not be able to entirely prevent such persons from seeking to interact with the Protocol, Tokens, and/or Token holders, including by circumventing the Company’s controls. Abuses of the Protocol and failures or alleged failures to comply with such laws and regulations may expose the Protocol, Token Holders, the Company, and/or Token holders to reputational harm as well as significant penalties, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures, and could negatively impact the development, growth, and utilization of the Protocol and market sentiment around the Tokens.',
  'Risk of Entering into a General Partnership. It could be alleged that by holding the Tokens or using Tokens to vote on governance proposals in relation to the Protocol, the holders of Tokens who are Token Holders have entered into a joint venture, general partnership, unincorporated association, or some other form of legal entity or association with other Token holders or a group of such holders. At least one court in the U.S. has found that certain holders of a governance token constituted an unincorporated association. If this were to be found or alleged with respect to the Protocol, holders of Tokens could be held responsible for the actions of the other members of the unincorporated association or general partnership, or the Protocol itself, and could be subject to up to unlimited liability with respect to those actions. Additionally, such an allegation could negatively impact market sentiment around the Protocol or the Tokens and discourage participation in the Protocol, or discourage engagement in governance of the Protocol or utilization of the Tokens.',
  'Risks Associated with the Tax Treatment of Digital Assets. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to digital asset transactions, the taxation of digital assets is uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the future on the treatment of digital asset transactions for tax purposes. Guidance under, or changes in, the tax laws applicable to of digital assets, including the Tokens, or the Company and/or its activities and transactions, either directly or through subsidiaries, could adversely impact the value of the Tokens or your ability to use or engage in certain types of transactions with the Tokens. The Company or its subsidiaries may also have tax reporting obligations in various jurisdictions with respect to the Tokens. You should consult a tax advisor with respect to the tax treatment of the Tokens in your jurisdiction.',

const operationalRisks = [
  'Risks of Competition. The Protocol and the Token compete against a variety of existing products and platforms as well as likely new entrants into the market. Some of these current or future competing protocols and products may be subject to different regulatory regimes than the Company, the Protocol, or the Tokens that may facilitate broader or faster adoption such that they can outcompete the Protocol. Alternatively, other competitors may exercise different amounts of control over the Protocol they design that allow for faster or broader adoption. Additionally, competitors may develop more successful protocols, applications, or tokens for a variety of other reasons, including but not limited to designing a more friendly user experience, offering more compelling incentives, attracting more developers and users to the Protocol, creating a more sustainable token economic design, or taking a more permissive view of applicable law.',
  'Risks of Security Weaknesses or Attacks. Cyberattacks and security breaches of an Application or the Protocol or the Tokens, or those impacting the Protocol’s Users or third parties such as decentralized applications or crypto wallets that interact with the Protocol or the Tokens, could cause you to lose your Tokens, or adversely impact the Protocol or the Tokens. The Protocol could be vulnerable in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, governance attacks, exploitable code, or any number of other currently known or novel methods of exploit. Additionally, as mentioned above, changes to the Protocol or the Tokens, which may be proposed, coded, and/or implemented by parties other than the Company or its Affiliates, could introduce new vulnerabilities to the Protocol or the Tokens or otherwise have unintended or malicious adverse effects on the Protocol and/or the Tokens. The Protocol and smart contracts generally execute automatically when certain conditions are met and typically cannot be stopped or reversed, so any vulnerabilities that may arise can have significant adverse effects to the Protocol, the Tokens, and holders of Tokens. Further, any actual or perceived breach or cybersecurity attack directed at crypto companies or blockchain networks, whether or not the Protocol is directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of user confidence in the crypto-economy or in the use of blockchain technology to conduct transactions, which could negatively impact the Protocol, including the market perception of the effectiveness of security measures and technology infrastructure. Digital assets are generally controllable only by the possessor of a unique public and private key pair. To the extent your private key for your wallet is lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, you will be unable to access the tokens held in such wallet. Any Tokens that are custodied, managed, escrowed, or supported by a third party may be subject to a security breach, cyberattack, or other malicious activity, or otherwise lost or stolen. Such an event could severely impact you and your Token holdings and your ability to use your Tokens.',
  'Risk of Decentralized Operations. Coordinating operations and implementation of feature updates, new product launches, or community initiatives amongst a distributed community can result in inefficiencies and delays. Such inefficiencies and delays could create stagnation around new developments and improvements to the Protocol and could allow more centralized competitors to act more efficiently and outcompete the Protocol, resulting in decreased usage or negative sentiment around the Protocol and the Tokens. Conversely, the Company or an Affiliate’s role as a contributor to research and development involving the Protocol and the Tokens presents certain risks, given the lack of operating history of the Company and its Affiliates, the relative inexperience of certain service providers, and the novel nature of the Protocol and potential use cases for the Tokens.',
  'Multi-Signature Wallet Risks. There will be certain multi-signature wallets that have certain transactional authorities and controls related to the Protocol and the Tokens, and these may include, but are not limited to, the ability to pause certain functionalities of the Protocol, reverse or pause slashing and implement certain other controls or changes to functionality. At this time, certain of these multi-signature wallets may be controlled by us or certain contributors or Token Holders engaged by us, and certain other wallets may be controlled partially or entirely by committee members that are unaffiliated third parties over which the Company has no or limited control. The current plan is to, from the launch of the Protocol, turn all multi-signature wallets over time to the community, to parties that are independent of the Company or its Affiliates. Those parties may choose to act in ways that could cause risk or damage to the Protocol or the uses of the Tokens.',
  'Unanticipated Risks. Cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based Protocols are new and untested technologies. The Tokens, as well as the Protocol and its design concepts, smart-contract mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters, may be updated and changed. In addition to these risks, there may be other risks associated with your claiming, using, buying, transacting in, and/or holding Tokens, including those which we cannot anticipate or have not specifically enumerated here. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed. Further, new risks may be created as the Protocol and the Tokens are developed (including by parties other than us) or third parties integrate the Tokens or the Protocol into their products. No person or entity, including the Company, has an ability or obligation to keep Participants informed of details related to development of the Protocol or the Tokens. Lack of available information may create risk for you.',
  'Fraudulent Websites. Some users have been targeted and/or have reported fraudulent websites, emails, text messages, and social media handles, often including embedded or published links, impersonating projects, persons, entities, or service providers of or associated with the Company for the purpose of defrauding users, stealing their digital assets, or otherwise unlawfully profiting from such activities. These fraud and theft risks may materialize in connection with Token Claims, and you should remain extremely cautious about websites, emails, text messages, and social media handles, as well as any embedded or published links, that direct you to websites or to take actions, especially connecting to your Wallet.',
