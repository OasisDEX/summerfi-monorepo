 * Fetches all rebalance activities from the GraphQL subgraph in batches.

 * This function makes multiple requests to the GraphQL endpoint until all rebalance activities
 * are retrieved. It handles pagination by using the `skip` and `first` arguments in the GraphQL request.
 * The process continues until all rebalance activities are fetched, determined by the batch size.
 *
 * @param {GraphQLClient} client - The GraphQL client used to send requests to the subgraph.
 * @param {string} timestamp - The timestamp used as a filter for the rebalance activities.
 * @returns {Promise<Rebalance[]>} - A promise that resolves to an array containing all the rebalances.
 *
 * @example
 * const rebalances = await fetchAllRebalanceActivities(client, '1625461923', network)
