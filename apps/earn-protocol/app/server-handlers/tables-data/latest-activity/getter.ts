/**
 * Fetches all the latest deposit and withdraw activities from multiple networks (Mainnet, Base, Arbitrum).
 *
 * This function fetches the latest activity data (deposits and withdraws) from three different networks
 * using GraphQL clients. It combines the activities, adds a `type` property to each item to distinguish
 * between deposits and withdraws, and sorts them in descending order by timestamp.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters for the function.
 * @param {Object} params.timestamps - The timestamps from which to fetch the latest activities.
 * @param {Object} params.clients - The GraphQL clients for the different networks.
 * @returns {Promise<LatestActivity[]>} - A promise that resolves to an array of latest activities from all networks.
 *
 * @example
 * const activities = await getAllLatestActivities({
 *   timestamps: {
 *     mainnet: '1620000000',
 *     base: '1620000000',
 *     arbitrum: '1620000000',
 *     sonic: '1620000000',
 *   },
 *   clients: {
 *     mainnetGraphQlClient,
 *     baseGraphQlClient,
 *     arbitrumGraphQlClient,
 *     sonicGraphQlClient,
 *   },
 * })
