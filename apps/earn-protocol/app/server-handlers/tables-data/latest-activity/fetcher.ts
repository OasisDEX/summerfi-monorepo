 * Fetches all latest deposit and withdraw activities from the GraphQL subgraph in batches.
 *
 * This function makes multiple requests to the GraphQL endpoint until all activities are retrieved.
 * It handles pagination by using the `skip` and `first` arguments in the GraphQL request.
 * The process continues until there are no more deposits or withdraws to fetch.
 *
 * @param {GraphQLClient} client - The GraphQL client used to send requests to the subgraph.
 * @param {string} timestamp - The timestamp used as a filter for the latest activities.
 * @returns {Promise<{ deposits: Deposit[], withdraws: Withdraw[] }>} - A promise that resolves to an object containing all the deposits and withdraws.
 *
 * @example
 * const { deposits, withdraws } = await fetchAllLatestActivities(client, '1625461923')
