**<u>Specifics of the LatAM 500 Offer</u>**: The LatAM 500 offer (the “Offer”) is a program where
eligible participants may receive $10 USD per month of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) to cover
gas transactions fees on the Ethereum blockchain network for three (3) months (total amount to
receive: $30 USD of ETH over three months). Only the first five hundred (500) users who
purchase Dai through [Latamex](https://latamex.com/ar/) will be eligible to participate in the Offer.

Representatives of MEGH (referenced below) will determine the first 500 users by the order in
which they complete their Dai purchase using the Latamex platform, including the time at which
the user purchases Dai with fiat currency and that Dai is transferred to said user’s non-custodial
cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., Metamask) that is linked to Oasis.app. Participants will be limited to
one wallet address and one connected email address. Once the Participants are determined,
representatives of Latamex will distribute ETH to said Participants once per business day. ETH
distributions pursuant to the Offer may take up to forty-eight (48) hours or longer to register in
the participant’s cryptocurrency wallet. Participants will only receive $10 USD of ETH in the
second and third month of the Offer if they maintain a balance of 1 Dai in the aforementioned
cryptocurrency wallet for the entirety of the Offer period.
